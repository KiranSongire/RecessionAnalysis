#Summary:

A recession is an economic situation that occurs when the economy's money circulation is low for two consecutive quarters. Recession is calculated and analyzed based on GDP growth, unemployment rate growth, and consumer spending rate growth.
The most common method of determining recession is to examine monthly GDP growth data.

So, for the task of Recession analysis, we need a dataset of a country's monthly GDP growth.(Here UK) I discovered an ideal dataset for this task that is based on the United Kingdom's monthly GDP growth rate.

In addition, in order to analyze the recession, I will convert our monthly data into quarterly data.
Analyzed the severity of Recession by quarterly data and barplot.
